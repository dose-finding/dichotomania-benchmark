This file contains the description of the functions require to run the Continuous and Binary Benchmark for Two Type of The Distributions of The Endpoint: Normal and Students; and provided
in the file "main-functions-upload.R".



> function ``cont.benchmark.normal(mu,sigma,n,nsims,target.level,target.probability,seed=100)''

computes the proportion of each dose selections by the Benchmark for Continuous Endpoint
as proposed in Section 2 if the Endpoint has a Normal Distribution for a given sample size;
The function uses the folowing parameters

+ ``mu'' is the vector of mean responses at each dose level

+ ``sigma'' is the variance [scalar or vector of length length(mu)] of the response at dose levels

+ ``n'' is the number of patients in the trial

+ ``nsims'' is number of simulations on which the benchmark is based 

+ ``target.level'' is the target response level, $\psi$

+ ``target.probability'' is the target probability level, $\gamma$ of getting the response of at least $\psi$

+ ``seed'' is used to reproduce the results



> function ``binary.benchmark.normal(mu,sigma,n,nsims,target.level,target.probability,seed=100)''

as proposed in Section 2 and described in Section 4.1 if the Underlying Endpoint has a Normal Distribution for a given sample size; The function uses the folowing parameters

+ ``mu'' is the vector of mean responses at each dose level

+ ``sigma'' is the variance [scalar or vector of length length(mu)] of the response at dose levels

computes the proportion of each dose selections by the Benchmark for Continuous Endpoint
as proposed in Section 2 if the Endpoint has a non-standard Student's distribution for a given sample size; The function uses the folowing parameters

+ ``mu'' is the vector of mean responses at each dose level 

+ ``sigma'' is the variance [scalar or vector of length length(mu)] of the response at dose levels

+ ``n'' is the number of patients in the trial

+ ``nsims'' is number of simulations on which the benchmark is based 

+ ``DF'' is the number of degrees of freedom for the Standard Student RV

+ ``target.level'' is the target response level, $\psi$

+ ``target.probability'' is the target probability level, $\gamma$ of getting the response of at least $\psi$

+ ``seed'' is used to reproduce the results

> function ``emax.model(d,Emax,ED,lambda)'' 

computes the response values under the Emax mode that is used in Section 3. The function uses
the following parameters:

+ ``d'' is the dose

+ ``Emax'' is the maximum effected at which the Emax function plateaus

+ ``ED'' is the ED50, the dose at which it is assume that the 50% of maximum effect is attained

+ ``lambda'' is the parameters of the slope in Emax function.
